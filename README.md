// Peer Review: Amazing looking website! It is responsive in all displays (Desktop, Tablet and Mobile). I like how when you choose shiny the evolution picture also changes to shiny.
Some nitpicks I would suggest is for the Moves box, the text is hugging the border. I would add some padding to give some space between the border and text.
For the evolutions, I like how they are gifs, but some of the pictures touch the top of the border. I would add some spacing to push it down a little more.
For the mobile evolution the images are hugging the box.
For the shiny and favorites, you should add a way so it shows the user that it's clickable.
In mobile the spacing, for the random favorite and mobile they aren't spaced evenly, it might bother someone with OCD.

Amazing built website! Keep up the great work!
